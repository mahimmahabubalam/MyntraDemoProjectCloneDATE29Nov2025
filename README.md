This is a front-end clone of Myntra, built using only HTML and CSS. The project aims to replicate the look and feel of the Myntra website, including the header, navigation bar, search bar, and action icons.

This project is part of my learning journey in web development, and it helped me practice:

HTML structure and semantic tags

CSS styling, flexbox, and layout design

Responsive design basics

Using Google Material Icons

⚠️ This is a practice project and not a functional e-commerce site. No backend or interactivity has been implemented yet.
